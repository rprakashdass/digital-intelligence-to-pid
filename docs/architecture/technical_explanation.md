## Part 2: Technical Explanation of the Backend Pipeline

Here is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the backend processes a P&ID image.

### Step 1: Image Ingestion and Preparation

When you upload an image, the process begins. The analysis pipeline itself is triggered by the `POST /analyze` request in `backend/main.py`.

1.  **File Handling**: The system first finds the image file (e.g., `e00081b4...png`) in the `temp_images/` directory.
2.  **PDF Rasterization**: If the uploaded file is a PDF, it cannot be processed directly by most computer vision libraries. The code calls `services.pdf.rasterize_pdf_to_image()`, which uses the `PyMuPDF` library to convert the first page of the PDF into a high-resolution PNG image. This process is called **rasterization**. The resulting PNG is what gets passed to the rest of the pipeline.

### Step 2: Parallel Extraction of Primitives (Symbols, Lines, Text)

The system now runs three core computer vision tasks to extract the basic elements from the image.

#### A. Text Extraction (OCR)
-   **File & Function**: `services/ocr.py` -> `ocr_image()`
-   **Technology**: Google's Tesseract OCR engine, via the `pytesseract` Python wrapper.
-   **Process**:
    1.  `pytesseract.image_to_data()` is called. This is the key function. It analyzes the image and returns a dictionary containing all detected words, along with their bounding boxes (`x, y, w, h`) and a confidence score for each word.
    2.  **Vertical Text Heuristic**: A simple but clever trick is used to handle vertically oriented text. The OCR is run once on the original image and a second time on the image rotated 90 degrees. The average confidence score of all detected words is calculated for both runs. The result with the higher average confidence is chosen for further processing. This helps correctly read labels that are often vertical on P&IDs.
    3.  **Output**: A list of `Text` objects. Each object stores a single detected word and its bounding box.
        -   *Example*: `Text(id='text_5', content='FIC-101', bbox=BoundingBox(x=150, y=200, w=75, h=20))`

#### B. Symbol Detection
-   **File & Function**: `services/symbols.py` -> `detect_symbols()`
-   **Technology**: OpenCV Template Matching.
-   **Process**:
    1.  **Load Templates**: On startup, the service loads small PNG images (e.g., `pump.png`, `valve_control.png`) from `data/templates/`. These are our "target" symbols.
    2.  **Sliding Window Search**: For each template, the `cv2.matchTemplate()` function performs a "sliding window" search across the main P&ID image. It compares the template to every possible region of the main image and calculates a similarity score (from -1.0 to 1.0) for each position.
    3.  **Thresholding**: The code identifies all locations where the similarity score is above a set threshold (e.g., `0.7`), indicating a likely match. This often results in multiple, overlapping detections for a single symbol.
    4.  **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: This is a critical de-duplication step. The `non_max_suppression()` algorithm takes all the detected bounding boxes, sorts them by their confidence score, and iterates through them. It selects the box with the highest score and eliminates all other boxes that significantly overlap with it. This process ensures that each symbol is detected only once.
    5.  **Output**: A list of `Node` objects with `kind="equipment"` or `"instrument"`.
        -   *Example*: `Node(id='symbol_0', kind='equipment', type='pump', bbox=..., confidence=0.85)`

#### C. Line & Junction Extraction
-   **File & Function**: `services/lines.py` -> `extract_lines_and_junctions()`
-   **Technology**: OpenCV Canny Edge Detection and Hough Line Transform.
-   **Process**:
    1.  **Canny Edge Detection**: The image is first converted to grayscale and blurred slightly to reduce noise. Then, `cv2.Canny()` is applied. This algorithm detects sharp changes in intensity, producing a black-and-white image that contains only the outlines (edges) of all shapes.
    2.  **Hough Line Transform**: The `cv2.HoughLinesP()` function is run on the edge image. This powerful algorithm is specifically designed to find straight lines. It works by converting points from image space to a "Hough space" where lines can be identified as peaks. The probabilistic version (`HoughLinesP`) is efficient as it only analyzes a subset of points.
    3.  **Output**: The function returns a list of `Edge` objects, where each object's `polyline` attribute contains the start and end coordinates of a detected line segment. It also creates simple `Node` objects with `kind="junction"` at the endpoints of these lines.
        -   *Example*: `Edge(id='line_12', kind='process', polyline=[(100, 150), (300, 150)])`

### Step 3: Graph Assembly - Building Intelligence

This is where the raw, disconnected elements are woven together into a structured graph.

-   **File & Function**: `services/graph.py` -> `assemble_graph()`
-   **Process**:
    1.  **Text-to-Node Association**: The code iterates through every symbol (`Node`) and finds the nearest `Text` object based on the Euclidean distance between their center points. If the distance is below a threshold, that text content is assigned as the symbol's `tag`. This is how an instrument bubble gets associated with its tag, "FIC-101".
    2.  **Text-to-Edge Association**: The same logic is applied to associate remaining text with the midpoints of lines, identifying line labels.
    3.  **Edge-to-Node Connection**: The code then iterates through every line (`Edge`). For each endpoint of the line, it searches for the nearest symbol or junction (`Node`). If a node is found within a small radius, the line's `endpoints` attribute is updated with the ID of that node. This digitally "connects" the pipe to the pump.
-   **Output**: A single, unified `Graph` object containing all nodes and edges with their relationships (tags and connections) now established.

### Step 4: Modeling and Exporting to DEXPI-lite

The final step is to convert our internal graph model into the standardized DEXPI-lite JSON format.

-   **File & Function**: `services/export.py` -> `to_dexpi_lite_json()`
-   **Internal Model (`models.py`)**:
    -   `Graph`: The main container holding lists of `Node`, `Edge`, and `Issue` objects.
    -   `Node`: Represents any object with a location (pump, valve, junction).
    -   `Edge`: Represents a line with a `polyline` and `endpoints` that reference the IDs of the nodes it connects.
-   **DEXPI-lite Model (`models.py`)**:
    -   This model separates objects by their class. Instead of one list of `nodes`, it has `equipment: []`, `instruments: []`, etc.
    -   Crucially, it separates the concept of a line's geometry from its connectivity.
        -   `DexpiLine`: Describes the geometry (the `polyline`).
        -   `DexpiConnection`: Describes the relationship, specifying which two nodes (`from_node`, `to_node`) are connected by which line (`line_id`).
-   **Conversion Process**:
    1.  The function iterates through the `Graph.nodes`. If a node is an "equipment", it's converted to a `DexpiEquipment` object.
    2.  It then iterates through `Graph.edges`. Each edge is converted into two separate DEXPI objects:
        -   A `DexpiLine` to store its shape.
        -   A `DexpiConnection` to store its connectivity, linking the IDs of the two nodes it connects.
    3.  The `classRef` attribute is a placeholder (e.g., `"placeholder/pump"`). In a full-fledged industrial system, this would be a formal URI pointing to a standard definition in an ontology like ISO 15926, ensuring interoperability.
-   **Final Output**: The complete `DexpiExport` object is serialized into a nicely formatted JSON string, ready for download.
